Problem :- 

Kata details
You are part of a team that explores the bottom of the sea using a remotely controlled submersible probe. Develop a REST API that allows control of the probe from the surface using a set of interpreted controls. 

Requirements:

You have a defined grid representing the ocean floor where location can be identified using x/y co-ordinates.
You are given an initial starting point (x,y) for the probe and the direction it is facing.
The probe will receive a collection of commands.
It should be able to:
Move forwards and backwards.
Turn left and right.
Stay on the grid.
Avoid obstacles in the grid.
Print a summary of the co-ordinates visited.

To Solve the Above problem, I created a Rest API which contain 4 Http Methods, and here is below Http methods details and testing data.

API 1 :- It is used to Initialize the remotely controlled submersible probe

To Test the API(Postman):--

URL: http://localhost:8080/probe/initialize
Method: POST
JSON Request:
 {
  "probe": {
    "x": 0,
    "y": 0,
    "direction": "NORTH"
  },
  "grid": {
    "width": 10,
    "height": 10,
    "obstacles": [
      {
        "x": 3,
        "y": 4
      }
    ]
  }
}


API 2 :- It is used to provide the commands to move the Probe forwards and backwards, Turn left and right and Stay on the grid. we can also provide multiple command all together as a list pf command to move the probe.

To Test the API(Postman):--

URL: http://localhost:8080/probe/commands
Method: POST
JSON Request:

{
  "commands": [
    "FORWARD",
    "RIGHT",
    "FORWARD"
  ]
}

API 3 :- It is used to get the visited co0rdinated of the Probe.

To Test the API(Postman):--

URL: http://localhost:8080/probe/visited
Method: GET

API 4 :- It is used to get the current co0rdinated/position and direction of the Probe.

To Test the API(Postman):--

URL: http://localhost:8080/probe/current
Method: GET
